export { extend } from '@kingjs/partial-reflect'

// Extend takes copies (merges) descriptors found on a partial type
// on to a targets type.

// If the partial type extends other partial types, logically, those 
// are merged in first. Members on the target type are not 
// overwritten unless they are abstract (i.e. are implemented as 
// @kingjs/abstract).

// All merged partial types are associated with the target type 
// (PartialLoader.addPartialType).

// Transparent partial types are merged but not associated. A transparent
// partial type is one whose prototype extends Attachments. Members of
// a transparent partial type are logically considered to be defined by 
// the partial type that "extended" it.
